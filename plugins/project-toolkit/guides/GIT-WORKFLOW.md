# Git Workflow

This guide documents the feature branch workflow used in the your project. This workflow ensures code quality, enables frequent small commits, and prevents accidental pushes to protected branches.

## Overview

The your project enforces a **feature branch workflow** to ensure code quality and enable frequent, small commits. All development work must be done on feature branches, and direct commits to main are blocked by Git hooks.

## Mandatory Workflow Rules

1. **No Direct Commits to Main** - A pre-push hook prevents direct pushes to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches
2. **Feature Branches Required** - All work must be done on feature branches
3. **Small, Focused Tasks** - Tasks should be 30-60 minutes maximum
4. **One Commit Per Task** - Each completed task MUST receive its own dedicated commit
5. **Frequent Commits** - Commit every 15-30 minutes of productive work
6. **Test Immediately** - Test after every task completion
7. **Pull Request Required** - All features require code review before merging

## Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch from main BEFORE starting work
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Work on ONE task at a time (30-60 min max per task)
# ...edit files for Task A...

# 3. Test your changes for this task
npm test  # or manual testing

# 4. Commit THIS TASK immediately after completion
# IMPORTANT: Verify you're on feature branch before committing
git branch --show-current  # Should show feature/your-feature-name
git add <files>
git commit -m "type: brief description of THIS task"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each subsequent task
# Task B → test → commit → push
# Task C → test → commit → push
# Each task gets its own commit!

# 6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub after ALL tasks complete
# IMPORTANT: Create PR from feature branch, do NOT checkout to main first
# The gh pr create command works from the feature branch
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# 7. After PR approval, merge and delete branch
gh pr merge <pr-number>
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

**Common Mistake to Avoid:**
- ❌ **DO NOT** checkout to main to create the PR - this often leads to accidentally committing on main
- ✅ **DO** stay on your feature branch and run `gh pr create` directly from there

## Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/project-discovery`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/sidebar-scrolling`)
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-deps`)
- `docs/` - Documentation only (e.g., `docs/api-reference`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/api-service`)

## Commit Message Format

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>: <brief description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting)

**Examples:**
```
feat: add project discovery service
fix: resolve sidebar scrolling issue
docs: update API endpoint documentation
chore: consolidate sidebar fix docs
test: add [Test 06] sidebar interaction tests
test: fix [Test 100] complete user flow timeout
```

**Test-Related Commit Messages:**

When working with tests, include the test number reference:
```
test: add [Test XXX] description
test: fix [Test XXX] description
test: remove [Test XXX] description
```

Where XXX is the test file number:
- 01-99: Frontend component tests
- 100-199: E2E integration tests
- 200-299: Responsive tests
- 300-399: Visual regression tests

## Why This Workflow?

Per the workflow analysis (see `docs/workflow-analysis-20251007.md`), the October 7 revert was caused by:
- Massive feature scope (2-3 hour chunks)
- No feature branches (100% work on main)
- Infrequent commits (40+ min gaps)
- Late testing (only after "completion")

This resulted in **350+ errors** and lost work. The new workflow prevents these issues by enforcing small, testable, reviewable changes.

## One Commit Per Task Policy

**Why it matters:**
- **Traceability:** Each commit maps to exactly one task, making history clear
- **Revert Granularity:** Can revert individual tasks without losing other work
- **Progress Visibility:** Commit history shows actual work progression
- **Code Review:** Reviewers can see logical progression of changes
- **Debugging:** Easier to identify when/where bugs were introduced

**How to implement:**

### Default: Sequential Work
When tasks must be completed in order:

1. **Start task** → Work on feature
2. **Complete task** → Test immediately
3. **Tests pass** → Commit immediately with task reference
4. **Push to remote** → Make work visible
5. **Start next task** → Repeat cycle

**Example (Sequential):**
```
Task 3.2.1: Create AgentCard component
→ Implement component (20 min)
→ Test rendering (5 min)
→ Commit: "feat: create AgentCard component (Task 3.2.1)"
→ Push to origin

Task 3.2.2: Add agent metadata display
→ Implement metadata (15 min)
→ Test display (5 min)
→ Commit: "feat: add agent metadata display (Task 3.2.2)"
→ Push to origin

Task 3.2.3: Add agent action buttons
→ Implement buttons (20 min)
→ Test interactions (10 min)
→ Commit: "feat: add agent action buttons (Task 3.2.3)"
→ Push to origin
```

### Exception: Parallel Work
When multiple tasks have **no dependencies** and **no file conflicts**, they can be executed in parallel with a batch commit:

**Criteria for parallel execution:**
- ✅ Independent files (or append-only shared files)
- ✅ No logical dependencies between tasks
- ✅ Same feature branch
- ✅ Similar scope (15-30 min each)

**Example (Parallel):**
```
Tasks 3.2.1-3.2.4: Four independent component files
→ Launch 4 agents in parallel (00:00)
→ Agent 1: AgentCard.js (6 min)
→ Agent 2: CommandCard.js (4 min)
→ Agent 3: HookCard.js (3 min)
→ Agent 4: MCPCard.js (3 min)
→ All complete at 00:06 (longest task)
→ Batch commit: "feat: implement configuration cards for all 4 types (Tasks 3.2.1-3.2.4)"
→ Push to origin

Time savings: 20 min sequential → 6 min parallel (70% reduction)
```

**Commit timing for parallel work:**
- Parallel execution: 4 tasks × 5 min = 5 min total (not 20 min)
- Single batch commit after all complete
- Still maintains "commit every 15-30 min" guideline if total parallel time < 30 min

**Reference:** See `docs/workflow-patterns/PARALLEL-EXECUTION.md` for detailed patterns

**Never bundle independent sequential tasks:**
- ❌ BAD (Sequential): "feat: implement agent card with metadata and buttons (Tasks 3.2.1-3.2.3)"
- ✅ GOOD (Sequential): Three separate commits, one per task
- ✅ GOOD (Parallel): "feat: implement 4 configuration cards (Tasks 3.2.1-3.2.4)" - if truly parallel execution

**Exception:** Only bundle related changes if they are part of the same atomic task (e.g., fixing a typo in documentation doesn't need its own commit if it's noticed during the same task).

## Pre-Push Hook

A pre-push Git hook is installed at `.git/hooks/pre-push` that prevents direct pushes to protected branches. If you accidentally try to push to main, you'll see:

```
❌ ERROR: Direct pushes to 'main' branch are not allowed!

Please use the feature branch workflow:
  1. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  2. Make your changes and commit
  3. Push your feature branch: git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
  4. Create a Pull Request for review
```

## Setting Up Git Hooks

To install the pre-push hook that enforces this workflow:

```bash
./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
```

This script copies the pre-push hook to `.git/hooks/` and ensures it's executable.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Template

When creating pull requests, use this template for consistency:

```markdown
## Summary
[Brief description of changes and their purpose]

## Changes Made
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]
- [Change 3]

## Testing Performed
- [ ] All tests passing (npm test)
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

## Screenshots (if applicable)
[Add UI screenshots or visual changes]

## Code Review
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met

## Related Issues
Closes #[issue-number]
Related to #[issue-number]
```

### PR Creation Process

1. **Ensure all tests pass** before creating PR
2. **Stay on your feature branch** when running `gh pr create`
3. **Use descriptive title** following commit message format
4. **Fill out PR template completely**
5. **Request review** from appropriate team members
6. **Respond to feedback** promptly

## Agent-Based Workflow Architecture

This project uses specialized Claude Code subagents for different aspects of development:

### Separation of Concerns

**Development Agents:**
- `project-toolkit:backend-developer` - Backend implementation
- `project-toolkit:frontend-developer` - Frontend implementation
- `data-parser` - Data parsing and utilities
- `project-toolkit:test-runner` - Test implementation

**Coordination Agents:**
- `project-toolkit:git-expert` - All git operations (commits, branches, PRs, merges)
- `project-toolkit:subagent-orchestrator` - Task delegation and workflow coordination
- `project-toolkit:code-reviewer` - Code quality and standards review
- `project-toolkit:documenter` - Documentation updates

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Orchestrator** assigns task to appropriate developer agent
2. **Developer** implements feature AND tests immediately (no git operations)
3. **Test Engineer** runs full test suite (if needed)
4. **Documentation Engineer** updates docs (if applicable)
5. **Code Reviewer** reviews implementation and tests
6. **Git Specialist** handles all git operations (commits, PRs)

### Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth** - All git operations centralized with git-expert
- **Consistent Standards** - Each agent follows specialized best practices
- **Clear Responsibilities** - Developers focus on implementation, not git mechanics
- **Better Code Review** - Dedicated review agent catches issues early
- **Audit Trail** - All operations traceable to specific agents

For SWARM-based development workflows, use the `/project-toolkit:swarm` command to launch coordinated multi-agent tasks.
