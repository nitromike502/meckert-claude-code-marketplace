## Test Fixtures and Data

### Model Values

**Always use enum values in test fixtures, never full model IDs:**

**Correct:**
```yaml
---
name: test-agent
model: sonnet
---
```

```yaml
---
name: test-command
model: haiku
---
```

**Incorrect:**
```yaml
---
name: test-agent
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022  # ❌ Don't use full model IDs
---
```

**Rationale:**
- Full model IDs change with every new release (e.g., `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `claude-3-5-sonnet-20250101`)
- Enum values (`sonnet`, `haiku`, `opus`) are stable across releases
- Tests remain valid even when new models are released
- Matches Claude Code's internal configuration format

**Valid Enum Values:**
- `sonnet` - Latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- `haiku` - Latest Claude 3 Haiku model
- `opus` - Latest Claude 3 Opus model

### Frontmatter Properties for Test Coverage

**Include comprehensive properties in test fixtures to ensure thorough test coverage:**

#### Agent Frontmatter

**Recommended (Comprehensive):**
```yaml
---
name: test-agent
description: Test agent description
tools: [Read, Write, Bash]
model: sonnet
color: blue
---
```

**Minimal (Acceptable for basic tests):**
```yaml
---
name: test-agent
description: Test agent description
---
```

**Properties:**
- **Required:** `name`, `description`
- **Optional (recommended for comprehensive tests):** `tools`, `model`, `color`
- Including optional properties exercises more code paths in parsers

#### Command Frontmatter

**Recommended (Comprehensive):**
```yaml
---
name: test-command
model: sonnet
allowed-tools: [Read, Write]
argument-hint: Optional hint text
disable-model-invocation: false
---
```

**Minimal (Acceptable for basic tests):**
```yaml
---
name: test-command
---
```

**Properties:**
- **Required:** `name`
- **Optional (recommended for comprehensive tests):** `model`, `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, `disable-model-invocation`
- Including optional properties ensures parsers handle all fields correctly

---

## Import Paths

### Backend (Node.js/Jest)

**Use relative paths:**

```javascript
// ✅ Correct - Backend tests use relative paths
const copyService = require('../../../src/backend/services/copy-service');
const { parseSubagent } = require('../../../src/backend/parsers/subagentParser');
```

**Rationale:**
- Jest does NOT have `@` alias configured in this project
- Relative paths work reliably across all Node.js environments
- Consistent with Node.js module resolution standards

### Frontend (Vite/Vue)

**Use @ aliases:**

```javascript
// ✅ Correct - Frontend uses @ aliases
import { useProjectStore } from '@/stores/projectStore';
import ConfigCard from '@/components/ConfigCard.vue';
import { apiClient } from '@/api/client';
```

**Rationale:**
- Vite has `@` alias configured in `vite.config.js` to point to `/src`
- Cleaner imports without `../../../` chains
- Standard Vue.js convention

**Vite Alias Configuration:**
```javascript
// vite.config.js
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src')
  }
}
```

## Documentation Placement

### When to Use Inline Comments

**Use inline comments for:**
- Brief explanations (< 20 lines)
- Algorithm complexity notes
- Cross-references to external documentation
- Quick implementation notes

**Example:**
```javascript
/**
 * HOOK STRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION
 *
 * For complete documentation, see: docs/technical/hook-structure.md
 *
 * Quick reference:
 * - Hooks use 3-level nested structure: Event → Matcher → Commands
 * - Deduplication key: event + matcher + command
 */
function mergeHooks(source, target) {
  // Implementation...
}
```

### When to Create Documentation Files

**Create documentation files (`docs/technical/`) for:**
- Extensive documentation (> 50 lines)
- Specification documents
- Complex algorithm explanations
- Architecture documentation
- Multi-component system documentation

**Example: docs/technical/hook-structure.md**
- Comprehensive hook structure specification
- Merge algorithm documentation
- Edge case handling
- Testing strategies

**Pattern:**
```
In code: Brief reference + link to docs
In docs/technical/: Comprehensive details with examples
```

**Benefits:**
- Code files stay focused and readable
- Documentation can be comprehensive without cluttering code
- Easier to maintain and update documentation
- Better for onboarding new developers

---

## CHANGELOG Policy

### Release-Time Updates Only

**IMPORTANT: CHANGELOG.md is maintained by project maintainers**
- Updates occur ONLY when cutting a new release (not during PR development)
- Do NOT update CHANGELOG.md in feature branches
- Do NOT include CHANGELOG updates in pull requests
- Follow "Keep a Changelog" format: https://keepachangelog.com/

**During Feature Development:**
- Focus on code comments, README updates, and inline documentation
- Update API documentation if endpoints change
- Update user guides if workflows change
- **Skip CHANGELOG** - it will be updated at release time

**At Release Time:**
- Project maintainer reviews all merged PRs since last release
- Maintainer adds consolidated CHANGELOG entry for the release
- Entry includes version number, date, and categorized changes

### Keep Entries Concise (When Release Time Comes)

**Maximum:** 3-4 bullet points per version
**Focus:** User-facing features only
**Avoid:** Implementation details, technical internals, test counts in every line

### Good Example

```markdown
## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-05

### Added
- Backend copy service for agents, commands, hooks, and MCP servers
- Conflict detection with smart resolution strategies
- Security hardening with path validation
- Comprehensive test coverage: 111 tests (100% pass rate)
```

### Bad Example (Too Verbose)

```markdown
## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-05

### Added
- Backend copy service for agents, commands, hooks, and MCP servers with the following features:
  - Agent copying with frontmatter parsing (23 tests)
  - Command copying with nested directory support (18 tests)
  - Hook copying with 3-level merge algorithm (31 tests)
  - MCP server copying with deduplication (19 tests)
  - Path validation service using regex patterns (12 tests)
  - Conflict detection service with 6 different strategies (20 tests)
  - Conflict resolution with rename, skip, and overwrite modes (15 tests)
  - Unique path generator with incremental suffixes (8 tests)
  - Atomic file writes using temp files (5 tests)
- Total: 151 lines of production code, 3,287 lines of test code
- Code coverage: 98.7% line coverage, 96.2% branch coverage
```

**Why This is Bad:**
- Overwhelming detail for end users
- Test counts belong in test reports, not CHANGELOG
- Line counts are irrelevant to users
- Implementation details obscure the actual features

### Guidelines

**DO Include:**
- High-level feature descriptions
- Breaking changes (with migration path)
- Security fixes
- Notable bug fixes
- Deprecations
- Overall test count (one line at end)

**DON'T Include:**
- Test counts for individual components
- Line counts (production or test code)
- Implementation details (algorithm names, file structures)
- Internal refactoring (unless it affects users)
- Technical debt cleanup

**Format:**
```markdown
### Added
- [Feature 1] - Brief user-facing description
- [Feature 2] - What users can now do
- Test coverage: X tests (100% pass rate)

### Changed
- [Change 1] - Impact on existing functionality

### Fixed
- [Bug fix] - What was broken and now works
```

## What NOT to Commit

### Excluded Files and Artifacts

**Never commit these files to the repository:**

#### Test Reports and Artifacts
```
# ❌ Don't commit
docs/testing/test-reports/report-2025-11-05.md
test-results/
playwright-report/
screenshots/
*-actual.png
*-diff.png
```

**Rationale:**
- Test results come from CI/CD pipelines and `npm test` output
- Test reports quickly become stale and outdated
- Screenshots and diffs are generated artifacts
- These files create noise in git history

**Exception:**
- Visual regression baseline images (`*-snapshots/`) ARE committed for comparison

#### Generated Documentation
```
# ❌ Don't commit (if auto-generated)
docs/api/generated/
docs/coverage/
```

**Rationale:**
- Generated docs can be recreated from source
- Often large and create unnecessary diffs
- Should be built during CI/deployment

#### Build Artifacts
```
# ❌ Don't commit (unless in dist/ for NPM)
build/
.cache/
.temp/
*.tmp
```

**Rationale:**
- Build outputs are generated from source
- Large binary files bloat repository size

**Exception:**
- `dist/` IS committed for NPM packages to enable instant `npx` startup

#### IDE and OS Files
```
# ❌ Don't commit
.DS_Store
.vscode/
.idea/
Thumbs.db
Desktop.ini
```

**Rationale:**
- Personal IDE preferences vary by developer
- OS-specific files are not relevant to the project
- Already covered in `.gitignore`

### Use .gitignore Appropriately

**Verify exclusions:**
```bash
# Check if file is ignored
git check-ignore -v path/to/file

# View effective .gitignore rules
git check-ignore -v *
```

**Key sections from project .gitignore:**
```gitignore
# Test artifacts
test-results/
playwright-report/
screenshots/
*-actual.png
*-diff.png

# Deleted files directory
.deleted/

# Build outputs (except dist/ for NPM)
build/
.cache/
.temp/
```

## Documentation Organization

### Directory Structure

```
docs/
├── guides/              # User and developer guides

    ├── TEST-FILE-INDEX.md
    └── test-reports/   # Excluded from git
```

### Avoid Duplication

**Anti-pattern:**
```javascript
// ❌ Don't duplicate extensive docs in code
/**
 * Hook Structure Documentation
 *
 * Hooks in settings.json follow this structure:
 * {
 *   "hooks": {
 *     "PreToolUse": [
 *       { "matcher": "*.ts", "hooks": [...] }
 *     ]
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Level 1 - Event Names:
 * Valid events: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit...
 *
 * Level 2 - Matcher Entries:
 * Each event has an array of matcher entries...
 *
 * [100+ more lines of documentation]
 */
function parseHooks() { ... }
```

**Better pattern:**
```javascript
// ✅ Brief reference in code
/**
 * Parse Claude Code hooks from settings.json
 *
 * Hooks use 3-level nested structure (Event → Matcher → Commands).
 * For complete documentation, see: docs/technical/hook-structure.md
 *
 * @param {object} settings - Settings object containing hooks
 * @returns {array} Flattened array of hook objects
 */
function parseHooks(settings) { ... }
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Test Data:** Use enum values (`sonnet`, `haiku`, `opus`) not full model IDs
2. **Frontmatter:** Include optional properties for comprehensive test coverage
3. **Imports:** Backend uses relative paths, frontend uses `@` aliases
4. **Documentation:** Brief comments in code, comprehensive docs in `docs/technical/`
5. **CHANGELOG:** Updated at release time only (not during PR development)
6. **Git Commits:** Don't commit test reports, generated docs, or IDE files
7. **File Organization:** Follow established directory structure
8. **Duplication:** One source of truth per concept
