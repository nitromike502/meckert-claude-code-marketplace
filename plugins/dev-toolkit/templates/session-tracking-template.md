## Execution Plan (from Orchestrator)

### Identified Tasks

#### TASK-X.X.1: [Task Description]
- **Subagent:** [agent-name]
- **Files:** [list of files to modify/create]
- **Dependencies:** [List dependencies or "None"]
- **Estimated Time:** [XX minutes]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] [Specific criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Specific criterion 2]

#### TASK-X.X.2: [Task Description]
- **Subagent:** [agent-name]
- **Files:** [list of files to modify/create]

- **Estimated Time:** [XX minutes]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] [Specific criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Specific criterion 2]

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Analysis:**
- Tasks X and Y can run in parallel because: [reason - independent files, no dependencies]
- Tasks A and B must run sequentially because: [reason - same file edits, logical dependencies]

**Decisions:**
- ✅ Parallel: TASK-X.X.4 || TASK-X.X.5 (independent services, 47% time savings)
- ❌ Sequential: TASK-X.X.1 → TASK-X.X.2 → TASK-X.X.3 (same file, dependencies)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: [Description]**
- **Impact:** [High | Medium | Low]
- **Mitigation:** [Specific strategy to address risk]

**Risk 2: [Description]**
- **Impact:** [High | Medium | Low]

## Template Usage Instructions

**For Main Agent:**

1. **Create this document at session start (Phase 2)** using this template
2. **Location:** `docs/sessions/tracking/SESSION-[TICKET-ID]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
3. **Update after each milestone:**
   - After each task completion
   - After each commit
   - After any significant decision
   - After encountering and resolving issues
4. **Keep "Critical Context for Session Resumption" comprehensive**
   - Write as if a fresh session needs to continue work
   - Include enough detail to understand state fully
   - Document WHY not just WHAT
5. **Move to `.deleted/` when PR merged (Phase 7)**
   - Use `git mv` to preserve history
   - Commit the move before merging PR

**For Fresh Session Resuming Work:**

1. **Read entire document** to understand context
2. **Start with "Critical Context for Session Resumption" section**
3. **Review "What Needs To Be Done Next"** for immediate actions
4. **Check "Known Issues / Blockers"** before starting work
5. **Review "Key Decisions & Rationale"** to align with architecture
6. **Continue updating document** as work progresses

**Key Principles:**

- ✅ Detail is better than brevity (this is for resumption)
- ✅ Document WHY decisions were made (rationale matters)
- ✅ Update immediately after events (don't batch updates)
- ✅ Include timestamps for all events
- ✅ Reference ticket IDs in all task descriptions
- ✅ Keep current status accurate at all times
